# ACM-C-intro-Workshop
ACM Intro to C Workshop

In this workshop I covered the basic programming concepts such as data types, variables, how to receive user input and print output, if conditions, and loops. 

I completed a mini project where I created a nightclub sign in system in C live in front of workshop attendees.
